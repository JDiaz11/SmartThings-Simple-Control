# SmartThings-Simple-Control
SmartThings Support said “it is unable to grab all the devices. If it is fairly "static" in what it can do, it shouldn't need to poll what devices you have and then make a list. It honestly sounds like old code to me that needs to be updated.” This is true, as the code was written in September, 2015.

Simple Control has agreed and stated that they are ““seeing this same behavior as well so it is safe to say the issue is not on the user side. Existing SmartApps using the SimpleSync app seem to be working just fine which is why we're receiving so little support traffic on this, but trying to configure a new SmartApp for the unpublished SimpleSync app fails at the blank screen indicated by the user. Meanwhile, the published Simple Control app that performs the reverse integration from our app to SmartThings seems to be working fine thankfully. So this affects only the unpublished app that routes from SmartThings to our Hub [Simple-Sync-Trigger]. However, users individually publish this app to their own accounts which makes mandatory changes to that app a global ordeal for everybody.”

The greatest ordeal is for the users who are suddenly unable to use a (high-priced) brilliant means of controlling and executing scripts on their computers, as well as IR/RF control of media devices via SmartThings.
