“seeing this same behavior as well so it is safe to say the issue is not on the user side. Existing SmartApps using the SimpleSync app seem to be working just fine which is why we're receiving so little support traffic on this, but trying to configure a new SmartApp for the unpublished SimpleSync app fails at the blank screen indicated by the user. Meanwhile, the published Simple Control app that performs the reverse integration from our app to SmartThings seems to be working fine thankfully. So this affects only the unpublished app that routes from SmartThings to our Hub [Simple-Sync-Trigger]. However, users individually publish this app to their own accounts which makes mandatory changes to that app a global ordeal for everybody.”

We haven't received any notifications of any needed changes and we have no further information on what might cause this so we will try to follow up with a SmartThings contact to find out.

As this issue apparently requires some kind of change on our side, we won't have much to add here until we develop support for whatever the changes on the SmartThings side were. We obviously have no ETA on that yet, but we have many SmartThings users so it's safe to say this will generally be a priority.
